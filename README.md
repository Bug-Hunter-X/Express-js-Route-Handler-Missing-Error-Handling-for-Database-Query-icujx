# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling when interacting with databases or external services.

The `bug.js` file shows an example of a route that fetches user data. If the database query fails (e.g., due to a network issue or database error), the code does not handle the error gracefully, leading to an unhandled exception or unexpected behavior.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with proper error handling using async/await and try...catch blocks.  This ensures that errors are caught and handled appropriately, preventing application crashes and providing informative error messages to clients.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the application: `node bug.js` (or `node bugSolution.js` for the solution)
4. Try to access a route that causes a database error. Note the different behavior between the buggy and corrected versions.
